## Note

This project is forked from https://github.com/machelreid/can-wikipedia-help-offline-rl and comes with a few changes like support for multi modal inputs. Specifically, I wanted to play with it in the context of MineRL.

The project is quite experimental and you might want to stick with the original, but maybe my fork can inspire some ideas for applying Machel's awesome work to a wider range of problems.
